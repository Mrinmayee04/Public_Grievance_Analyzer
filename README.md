# Public_Grievance_Analyzer
## 🔍 Project Overview

Traditional grievance systems are often plagued by slow response times, manual data entry, and fragmented data sources. Our solution leverages artificial intelligence to overcome these challenges and ensure faster, more accurate, and transparent handling of public complaints.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **AI-Based Grievance Classification**  
  Utilizes a Naive Bayes Classifier to categorize complaints (e.g., water, electricity, banking).

- **Groq LLaMA-3.3-70B Model Integration**  
  For advanced analysis, faster routing, and proactive pattern detection.

- **Legacy System Integration**  
  Connects with VSAM KSDS databases using Paramiko for seamless data access.

- **Document Processing**  
  Extracts and processes information from various file formats using PyMuPDF.

- **User Interface**  
  A clean and intuitive grievance submission and tracking platform built using Streamlit.
